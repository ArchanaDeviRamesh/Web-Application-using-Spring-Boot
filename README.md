# Web-Application-using-Spring-Boot

A simple web application created using Spring Boot framework using the Spring Tool Suite IDE.

For building the web application, we have used the framework, Spring Boot which is mainly based on Java Programming language. 

This framework makes it easy to create stand-alone Spring based Applications that helps us accelerate application development. 

We used the IDE Spring Tool Suite (STS) for this purpose. This IDE is open source and requires JDK 8 or later. 

This tool can be used to write .html files, .java files, .css files required for building a web application.
